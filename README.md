# Variational_Quantum_Classifier

This is a classification task and used the methods of Quantum Computing for classification.

The code was extracted from Pennylane.

Firstly, I had created a quantum device to run my circuit.
Then constructed the layers using basic Rotation and CNOT gates.
Defined weights and bias for the layers.
Extracted the training data, applied training data to the model and then applied the model to the unseen test data and predicted the labels.
